	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes how the runtime of an algorithm changes based on input size. An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity, meaning it performs well even for large inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. It is often expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the input size.</p>
